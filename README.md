# Breast-Histopathology-IDC-Classification
Invasive Ductal Carcinoma (IDC) is the most common subtype of all breast cancers.

The goal of the project is to predict wheather it contains IDC or not for a given patient and a patch of a tissue slice.

The project is under progress and is using Tensorflow 2.0 to build CNN model.
